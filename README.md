Those lists are used at different schoolinfrastrucktures to block inappropriate websites for pupils. Besides the blocklist, there is also an allow-list for websites here in Germany, which some of the teachers needs for daily business. 

Those lists are formatted for the direct usage in AdGuard. Also the Blocklist is based on MSNplus.

KEEP IN MIND

Do not use those lists alone. The idea behind this is to make an addition to different blocklist out in the wild based on my experience at work.
